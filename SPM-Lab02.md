### ***Description***:

The HAM Group has decided to address the highly potential market of online servicing for restaurants. The reason for this is, the team just wants to get in on that part of the market, make some impressions on how we can tackle the application. The goal of tackling this problem will be to bring satisfaction to those using it, and those buying it off us to enhance their business, and ultimately help improve our business to continue on as a significant company. One of the problems that will be tackled is the clarity of the items the user wants. The next one is the efficiency of the application. The software needs to make it smooth for the customer to get in, order, and have it ready when they arrive at the front of the restaurant. 



#### ***Objective***:

Once you've downloaded and installed the restaurant POS app, your iPad becomes a powerful mobile point-of-sale that you can use to run the front of your restaurant. It can help you seat customers, take orders, add modifiers, split bills, accept payments, manage tabs, track tips and more. Many also offer access to the system's back-of-house features as well. 

**Menu and Order Management**:

The system should allow you to update or change the menu at will – adding, removing and editing items as needed, and adding pictures and descriptions. If you have an online menu or display boards, it should give you the option to sync updates across all of them at once rather than updating each one separately. 

**Inventory Management**:

Ordering ingredients is challenging – especially when they're perishable. Order too much and they spoil. Order too little and you run out, disappointing hungry customers who were eager to order their favorite menu items. For this reason, you need a system with real-time inventory tracking and ingredient-level detail, showing you the exact quantities you use so you can optimize your supply orders. Some systems alert you when supplies are running low and have automated purchase-ordering tools that can save you time.

**Employee Management**:

If you have employees who will be using the POS terminal, you'll want to create user profiles, assign passcodes and designate access permissions, whether by role or customized for each employee. If you use your POS system to track your labor costs, it should prompt you to enter pay rates.
